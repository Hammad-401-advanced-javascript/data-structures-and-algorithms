# singly Linked Lists

## Challenge :

* Creat a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
* Within your LinkedList class, include a head property.and we do in it this methods : insert / includes/toString


## Approach & Efficiency

* class
* if statment 
* while loop
<<<<<<< HEAD
* O(n)


<!-- solve the conflict -->
=======
* Big(O): time O(1)
 includes and toString O(1)

 space insert O(n),includes and toString O(1)
